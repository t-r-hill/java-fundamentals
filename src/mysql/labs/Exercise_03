*  MySQL Exercise 3:
*
*   Now that you have your air travel database all set up and populated, please demonstrate how to:
*
*       1.) Query all flights on a specific day
        SELECT *
        FROM air_travel.flights
        WHERE DATE(datetime) = "2022-01-01";
*       2.) Query all flights between two specific cities on a specific day
        SELECT *
        FROM flights f
        JOIN destinations df
        ON f.destination_from_id = df.id
        JOIN destinations dt
        ON f.destination_to_id = dt.id
        WHERE DATE(f.datetime) = "2022-01-01"
        AND df.country = "UK"
        AND dt.country = "Japan";
*       3.) Query all passengers on a specific flight between two specific cities today
        SELECT p.*
        FROM passengers p
        JOIN tickets t
        ON p.id = t.passenger_id
        JOIN flights f
        ON t.flight_id = f.id
        JOIN destinations df
        ON f.destination_from_id = df.id
        JOIN destinations dt
        ON f.destination_to_id = dt.id
        WHERE f.id = 6
        AND df.city = "Sydney"
        AND dt.city = "Sydney";
*       4.) Query the flight information for a specific passenger on a specific flight
*       5.) Query the passenger information for a specific user on a specific flight yesterday
*       6.) Query the number of flights between two specific cities this week, month, and year
        SELECT count(f.id)
        FROM flights f
        JOIN destinations df
        ON f.destination_from_id = df.id
        JOIN destinations dt
        ON f.destination_to_id = dt.id
        WHERE df.country = "UK"
        AND dt.country = "Australia"
        AND f.datetime >= "2022-01-01"
        AND f.datetime < "2023-01-01";
*       7.) Query the number of passengers that travelled between two specific cities today, this week, month and year
*       8.) Insert records for new flights between airports
*       9.) Insert records for new tickets and passengers on specific flights
*       10.) Update meal preference (or something similar) for a specific passenger on a specific flight
*       Bonus: Have some fun - get creative - what else can you do? Flex those SQL muscles and show us what
*           you've got! :)
